# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains detailed explanations, implementations, and examples of various algorithms and data structures. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for understanding and applying algorithms and data structures in Python. Each topic is accompanied by:

- **Explanations**: Detailed breakdowns of the concepts.
- **Python Implementations**: Example code to illustrate the concepts.
- **Applications**: Use cases and scenarios where they can be applied.
- **Practice Problems**: Links to problems and solutions for better understanding.
